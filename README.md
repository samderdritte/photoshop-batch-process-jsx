# Photoshop batch process

This project demonstrates a simple script to automate the export of multiple png files from Adobe Photoshop.


The script BatchRender.jsx uses the data from Data.csv to create PNG-files with different text.

##Usage:

1. Open the .psd file in Adobe Photoshop
2. Go to Select > Scripts > Browse.. and select the .jsx file from the project folder
3. When the script is finished, the newly created files are stored in a folder "Export" in the project directory.
